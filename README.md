## **Project Overview**

I analyzed a dataset of over **500,000 sales records** from an Apple-like database. This project involved extensive querying to explore **customer behavior**, **product performance**, and **sales trends** using **Microsoft SQL Server**. Throughout the analysis, I addressed various SQL problems related to **store performance**, **product sales**, and **warranty claims**.

The project mainly focuses on solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

## ERD Diagram
An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.
In this I have used 5 tables and the ERD diagram as shown below.

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

- **Removed Duplicates:** Identified and eliminated duplicate records in the `categories`, `products`, and `stores` tables  
- **Checked for Missing Values:** Conducted a thorough review across all five tables; no critical missing data required correction  
- **Analyzed Null Values:** Evaluated null entries across all tables; found no necessary changes needed

## **Objective and Business Problems**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects like:
- Identifying the **top-selling stores and products**
- Calculating the **correlation between product price and warranty claims** for products sold in the last five years, segmented by price range
- Computing **year-over-year growth** for stores
- Analyzing **warranty trends and void claims**
- Segmenting **sales trends by product lifecycle**
- Additional problems can be found in the [Questions.pdf](https://github.com/DevanshLath45/Apple-Data-Analysis---SQL/blob/main/Questions.pdf) file.

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Apple Mumbai and iPhone 15 Pro dominate sales.
2. A very slight negative correlation between product price and warranty suggests that higher product prices do not necessarily translate to fewer warranty issues.
3. Inconsistent year-over-year growth across stores, highlighting the need for localized strategies to address underperforming locations.
4. Around 26% of warranty claims are marked as void, suggesting issues in the claims process or customer misuse.
5. Products like iPhone 14, 14 Pro, 15, and 15 Pro see most of their sales within the first 6 months, pointing to rapid demand drop-offs and potential inventory management challenges.
6. See the [Outputs.pdf](https://github.com/DevanshLath45/Apple-Data-Analysis---SQL/blob/main/Outputs.pdf) file for additional outputs generated from the analysis.
