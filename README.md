This project involved analyzing key areas such as **store performance**, **product sales**, and **warranty claims**.

Using SQL, I addressed several business questions, including:

- Calculating the **correlation between product price and warranty claims** for products sold in the last five years, segmented by price range
- Computing **year-over-year growth** for stores
- Analyzing **warranty trends and void claims**
- Segmenting **sales trends by product lifecycle**

ðŸ’¡ **Key Highlights:**
